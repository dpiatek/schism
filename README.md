Schism
======

Schism is an attempt to bring modularity to CSS, using SCSS, BEM inspired naming schemes and a set of rules for creating components. It uses heavily SCSS mixins and encourages you to avoid many of CSS main features: "smart" selectors, the cascade, specificity (if you can call specificity a feature). 

It is a framework and methodology and aimed at larger projects, where maintainability is a prime concern. Separation is encouraged over DRY, composition over inheritance. As such, it might be a bit verbose for smaller projects.
